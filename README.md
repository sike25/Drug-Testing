# Drug-Testing
The summary, analysis and plotting of the results from a clinical trial carried out on the virtual population called "The Islands".

## Question
To what extent do psilocybin mushrooms and vodka affect a person’s ability to pay attention?

## Hypothesis
We expected psilocybin mushrooms and vodka to  decrease the attention of our participants. 

## Participation Criteria

We picked subjects from four villages that were all on the same island of Providence and were all coastal regions, to minimize diversity in the data that could be due to location. We also picked subjects that were 21 to 65 years old, because we took into account the legal age for drinking and the upper limit with which experimenters tend to pick subjects. We also could not consider subjects who were ill, pregnant or had an attention disorder. We took account of the subject’s gender and drinking habits; these were not factors for exclusion.
We had sixty subjects in total, twenty in each of three treatment groups.

## Attention Test (Designed by the creator of The Islands)
Subjects are given a screen in which random letters pop up sporadically. Subjects are prefaced to only touch the letter “Z” in order to measure their attention rates. The better you pay attention to the screen, the less likely you are to miss any Z’s.

## Methods
1. Attention Test given prior to treatment
2. Treatment: 10g of psilocybin mushrooms or 2 shots of Vodka (30 ml each) or Sugar pill
3. Given twice in 30 minute increments post-treatment
There were three treatment groups: the psilocybin mushrooms, the vodka and the treatment pill. And they were all applied in to people from the different towns and of different genders in equal numbers.
